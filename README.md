# Code Fellows 301 Lab 02

This is Lab 02 for Code Fellows 301 course. The purpose of this lab is to gain a better understanding of using jQuery selectors and handling events through jQuery. This lab will add a gallery of images and give the user the ability to filter them by a keyword.

### Update 4/9/2020
Lab 03 is being added to the project. This will add a second .html page with it's own unique image gallery. It will use some new features for layout and design like template and flexbox. There will also be a sorting feature added.
